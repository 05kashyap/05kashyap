executive director’s remuneration package in their \\nprior role the market positioning of the remuneration package and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the \\nrecruitment of the

that any legacy arrangements would be honoured \\nin line with the original terms and conditions\\nfixed elements\\nbase salary benefits and \\nother benefits\\n we recognize that salary levels drive

policy and operation\\nbuyout awards\\n the committee will consider what buyout awards if any are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a \\nnew executive director in all circumstances this includes an assessment of the awards which would be forfeited on \\nleaving their current employer\\n the committee will seek to structure any buyout awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms of \\nquantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited\\n in determining the quantum and structure of these commitments the committee will seek to provide broadly \\nequivalent value and replicate as far as practicable the timing and performance requirements of the awards \\nforfeited\\n buyout awards if used will be granted using the company’s existing longterm incentive plans to the extent possible \\nalthough awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the listing rules\\n in the case of an internal hire any

contracts and termination arrangements for executive directors is set out below on principle it is the committee’s \\npolicy that there should be no element of reward for failure the committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of a loss of office \\nis to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for the loss of office company and individual performance

for nick wood and six months for ian kellett\\n new executive directors will be appointed on service contracts that have a notice period of not more than 12 months for \\nboth the company and the

the potential liabilities of the company in the event of \\ntermination\\ncontractual payments\\n executive directors’ service contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the company or termination by \\nway of payment in lieu of notice pilon at the company’s discretion payment in lieu of notice would be made where \\ncircumstances dictate that the executive directors’ services

only \\nopinions and conclusions arising from our audit\\n1 our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified \\nwe have audited the financial statements of pets at home group plc for the year ended 27th march 2014 set out on pages 108 to 156 in our \\nopinion \\n the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 27th march 2014 and of \\nthe group’s profit for the year then ended \\n the group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with international financial reporting standards as adopted by the \\neuropean union ifrss as adopted by the eu \\n the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with ifrss as adopted by the eu and as applied in \\naccordance with the provisions of the companies act 2006 and \\n the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the companies act 2006 and as regards the group \\nfinancial statements article 4 of the ias regulation \\n2 our assessment of risks of material misstatement\\nin arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were  \\nas follows\\nipo accounting and disclosures\\nrefer to page 78 audit committee report pages 116118 accounting policy and pages 140141 financial disclosures\\n the risk the public listing of the group in march 2014 was preceded by changes to the group’s legal structure the restructuring involved a \\nnumber of legal steps which included the issue of a mix of debt and equity and resulted in significant transaction costs some of which were \\nrecorded as a deduction from debt and equity due to the complex nature of these transactions and the judgement involved in allocating the \\ncosts this has been an area of focus for our audit this year \\n our response our audit procedures included among others assessing the validity and accurate reflection of each of the steps to create the \\nnew corporate structure we inspected external legal advice obtained by the group to assess if the group’s capital structure has been correctly \\naccounted for in line with companies act 2006 requirements we used our own financial reporting specialists to assist us in challenging the \\naccounting principles applied we also challenged the appropriate classification of transaction costs as an expense or deduction from debt or \\nequity and assessed whether the financial statement disclosures in relation to the ipo are sufficient and appropriate\\ncarrying value of inventory £461m\\nrefer to page 79 audit committee report page 122 accounting policy and page 136 financial disclosures\\n the risk inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value the group is exposed to inventory recoverability risk as a result of new \\nproduct launches changes in customer preferences and consumer spending patterns with respect to the group’s products the group carries a \\nbroad range of products some with a limited shelf life and may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities during the relevant seasons it \\nmay be difficult to accurately forecast demand when a new product is launched and the demand for products may also change between the time \\ninventory is ordered from suppliers and the date of sale as such there is a risk that the carrying value of inventory exceeds its net realisable \\nvalue\\n our response our audit procedures included among others assessing the principles and appropriateness of the group’s inventory provisioning \\npolicies based on our understanding of the business and the accuracy of previous provisioning estimates we obtained the inventory provision \\ncalculation and performed a recalculation of the amounts we challenged whether inventory lines and sales prices had been appropriately \\nincluded in the calculation through an analysis of data from both the inventory and sales system we analysed specific attributes including \\nhistorical sales trends the ageing of individual inventory lines and sales prices we also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of \\namounts recognised as provision against inventory during the period\\n3 our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit\\nthe materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £20m this has been determined with reference to a benchmark of group \\nprofit before taxation which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for members of the company in assessing the financial performance \\nof the group materiality represents 38 of pbt adjusted for items disclosed separately on the face of the income statement\\nwe agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in excess \\nof £01m in

current year and comparative primary financial statements and notes\\nfor the consolidated financial statements of the group prepared under ifrs the principles of reverse acquisition accounting under ifrs 3 \\n”business combinations” have been applied the steps to restructure the group had the effect of pets at home group plc “plc” being inserted \\nabove pets at home lux sarl “pah lux” as the holders of pah lux share capital and preferred equity certificates “pecs” exchanged their \\npah lux shares and a portion of their pecs for shares in plc\\nby applying the principles of reverse

section 12 the impact on the primary consolidated financial \\nstatements is as follows\\n equity reflects the capital structure of plc  as part of the restructuring of the group a number of shares in plc were issued in exchange for \\nvarious instruments or for cash the premium arising on the issue of shares is allocated between the share premium and merger reserve\\n a consolidation reserve is created this reflects the difference between the plc reserves at the balance sheet date as reflected in the \\nopening reserves at the start of the comparative period 29th march 2012 and the consolidated equity of pah lux at the same date\\n prior to their cancellation as part of the ipo restructure the pecs issued by pah lux and shown as additional paid in capital in the \\nconsolidated financial statements are shown as equity and the coupon charged on them is charged through reserves as a dividend \\n as part of the restructure the pecs were ultimately exchanged for a combination of

against the secured bank debt will be amortised over the period of the financing fees charged to \\nthe consolidated income statement have been presented as exceptional items\\n due to the timing of the ipo not all fees had been paid at year end and hence there were significant balances in trade and other creditors \\nfor outstanding fees  \\n the group refinanced its external bank debt using
